                    Hi, you can call me Angie.
                    ‚Äç<br><br>
                    I am a first-year student at HZ University of Applied Sciences studying ICT.
                    Whilst I will be figuring out where my interests in IT lie throughout the years,
                    you can follow most of my progress on this portfolio website.
                    <br><br>
                    Besides university and work related items, such as my projects and CV, you will find personal things as well.
                    Have a look at some of my analogue photos and trips around the world.
                </p>
